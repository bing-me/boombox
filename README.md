## Usage

- After creating an account, users can create goals, pen their thoughts into insights for any goal.
- Highlight any part of their insights to add it to their highlights, and refer to their highlights.
- Users can add other users to collaborate on their goals and choose to accept or reject a collaboration request.
- Collaborators can leave comments on an insight of a goal they are collaborating on.

## Known issues

As this project is a proof-of-concept demo, the prompts for insights are limited.

The app works best on desktop devices.
