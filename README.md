# Boombox

Boombox is a social network meant to look similar to a social media website that millenials would have you believe that do not use, in spite of the largest demographic on the site being millenials.

## Usage

- After creating an account and view posts made by all users.
- Users can make a post with an image.
- Users can view user profile pages, this only shows posts made by that user.

## Known issues

As this project is a proof-of-concept demo, the features are limited.
Using Boombox may lead to countless hours of scrolling through posts, and a sudden urge to start using words like 'lit' and 'fam' unironically. Proceed with caution.
